T1:  Single aircraft

T2:  Two aircraft, one en-route and other free, not crossing trajectories
T3:  Two aircraft, one en-route and other free, crossing trajectories, no conflict
T4:  Two aircraft, one en-route and other free, crossing trajectories, proximity
T5:  Two aircraft, one en-route and other free, crossing trajectories, crash

T6:  Two aircraft in two parallel routes

T7:  Two aircraft in two perpendicular routes, no conflict
T8:  Two aircraft in two perpendicular routes, proximity
T9:  Two aircraft in two perpendicular routes, crash

T10: Two aircraft in two oblique routes, no conflict
T11: Two aircraft in two oblique routes, proximity
T12: Two aircraft in two oblique routes, crash

T13: Two aircraft in two merging routes (oblique by definition, no 90 degree turns), no conflict
T14: Two aircraft in two merging routes, proximity on merging point
T15: Two aircraft in two merging routes, crash on merging point
T16: Two aircraft in two merging routes, crash on common segment

Specific values of COMETA parameters are essential for these tests to make sense.
In general, I reuse default values excep in the following cases:
 - Time to compute conflict: 60 seconds
 - Horizontal conflict distance: 2 nm
